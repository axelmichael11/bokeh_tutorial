Installation!! 
Use pip to install Flask with...

pip install Flask


To run the application you can either use the flask command or pythonâ€™s -m switch with Flask. Before you can do that you need to tell your terminal the application to work with by exporting the FLASK_APP environment variable:

$ export FLASK_APP=app.py
$ flask run
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
If you are on Windows, the environment variable syntax depends on command line interpreter. On Command Prompt:

C:\path\to\app>set FLASK_APP=app.py
And on PowerShell:
PS C:\path\to\app> $env:FLASK_APP = "app.py"
Alternatively you can use python -m flask:

$ export FLASK_APP=app.py
$ python -m flask run
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
